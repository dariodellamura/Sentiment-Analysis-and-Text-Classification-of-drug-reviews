# Sentiment-Analysis-and-Text-Classification-of-drug-reviews
Bert Model, Vader 

For the text Mining course I carried out a project related to the analysis and classification of the reviews of the "UCI ML Drug Review" dataset (link:https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Drug+Review+Dataset+%28Drugs.com%29). I learned to apply techniques such as bag of words, TF-IDF and build sentiment analysis models through the Bert and Vader model.
